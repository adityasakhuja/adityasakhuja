- 👋 Hi, I’m Adi
- 👀 I’m interested in startups, environment, sustainability and web development
- 🌱 I’m currently RE-learning web design and developments as I venture back into the field after a 5 year hiatus (Man, things have changed!)
- 🖥️ I'm going through the freeCodeCamp content as quickly as I can so I can actually get down to working on real projects
- 📫 You can reach me @adisakhuja on Twitter
